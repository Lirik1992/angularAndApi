# AngularJS Devices Manager

This project is built in order to be a kind of best practices (or common programming approach) presentation.

I don't pretend, that everything i write is 100% right, but you're free to use that code, hope it'll help you somehow.

### Server

I'm using node.js express server. To run it, simply type -npm i , then node start.
Nodemon is working strange, or rather it did not want to work on machine, I almost sure that it is problem with proxy (keep it in mind).

To simply start the server open terminal and type -npm start 
Start with nodemon -nodemon start
